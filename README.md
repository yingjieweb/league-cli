# League CLI
League CLI can help you quickly build a front-end project with Vue and League UI.

## Installation
To install the new package, use one of the following commands. You need administrator privileges to execute these unless npm was installed on your system through a Node.js version manager (e.g. n or nvm).

```
npm install -g league-cli
# OR
yarn global add league-cli
```

After installation, you will have access to the `league` binary in your command line. You can verify that it is properly installed by simply running `league`, which should present you with a help message listing all available commands.

You can check you have the right version with this command:

```
league --version
```
